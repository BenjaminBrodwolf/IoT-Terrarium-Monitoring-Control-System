## Introduction
* 2 person teams, building an IoT system.
* 32 hours of work per person, 1 prototype.
* 10' presentation of the project at Demo Day.
* Project source code and setup steps on GitHub.
* Both team members are able to explain the project

## Deliverables

### Source code
* Source code, commited to (this) project repo.
1) Embedded code / microcontroller firmware.
2) Glue Code used on the gateway or "in the cloud".
3) App or Web UI code, or IoT platform setup steps.

### Presentation
4-page PDF, commited to (this) project repo.
1) Use-case.
2) Reference model.
3) Short, one slide interface docs.
4) Issues you faced, how you solved them.

### Live Demo
Working end-to-end prototype, "device to cloud".
1) Sensor input on a IoT device triggers an event.
2) The event / measurement shows up online.
3) The event triggers actuator output<sup>*</sup>.

<sup>*</sup>) Same or separate device, details are up to you.
