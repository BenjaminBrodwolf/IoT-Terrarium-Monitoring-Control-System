2) Glue Code used on the gateway or "in the cloud".
3) App or Web UI code, or IoT platform setup steps.

### Presentation
4-slide presentation, PDF format, committed to (this) project repo.

[MY_TEAM_PROJECT_PRESENTATION.pdf](MY_TEAM_PROJECT_PRESENTATION.pdf)

1) Use-case of your project.
2) Reference model of your project.
3) Single slide interface documentation.
4) Issues you faced, how you solved them.

### Live demo
Working end-to-end prototype, "device to cloud", part of your 10' presentation.

[https://MY_TEAM_PROJECT_DEMO_HOST:PORT/](https://MY_TEAM_PROJECT_DEMO_HOST:PORT/)

1) Sensor input on a IoT device triggers an event.
2) The event or measurement shows up online, in an app or Web client.
3) The event triggers actuator output on the same or on a separate IoT device.

## Submission deadline
Commit and push to (this) project repo before Demo Day, _03.06.2019, 00:00_.
